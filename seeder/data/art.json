And as we all know cat's are used to secure the house mainly from rats and other pest but this a cat idly sitting there while a rat eats the fruit. We can relate this to our security agents who sit there idly while the people's property are being stolen with the mindset that it does not concern them , it is not thier problem as it is not thier property, we only have a few who are really responsible and take thier job seriously.The fruit symbolizes the properties of the citizen while the rat symbolizes the notorious thieves, robbers and thugs who take money from people by force.All in all the artwork symbolizes the negligence of security agents. The laziness the show affects the life of citizens",

    "description": "Motivated by the enduring challenges faced by Nigeria, particularly those stemming from political, social, and religious upheavals, I've channeled my artistic expression to address the nation's economic struggles exacerbated by persistent security issues. In this artwork, I depict security agents in the guise of a cat, a creature traditionally associated with protection.Within the visual narrative, the cat sits idly as a rat feasts on a fruit—a symbolic portrayal of the passive stance adopted by some security agents. This composition serves as a powerful metaphor for those who, like the indifferent cat, remain unmoved by the theft and violation of citizens' properties. The fruit represents the possessions of the populace, while the rat embodies the menacing presence of criminals exploiting the vulnerability of the citizens. Ultimately, my artwork seeks to convey the profound impact of security agents' negligence on the lives of the people, emphasizing the urgency for a more vigilant and responsible approach to their duties.",

This figure stands at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out into the distance as the sun sets.

It is a visual meditation on the beauty of solitude, the fleeting nature of time, and the ever-present desire to find a moment of peace amid the chaos of modern life.",

    "description": "The painting depicts the Nigerian interpretation of the Mona Lisa, which I've named 'Mona Lola.' Mona Lola beautifully showcases the strength and African beauty inherent in women. The emergence of independent women in today's society underscores their growing prominence. It's essential not to sideline them in decision-making processes but to consult them, as they possess invaluable wisdom. The Lagos scene in the background exemplifies the Nigerian version of Mona Lola's story. I firmly believe that women hold the key to the tapestry of life. By allowing them to participate in government, administrative councils, and leadership roles, they can contribute significantly to guiding Nigeria toward its promised future.",

I come from Nigeria and there is a lack of accessibility of quality education.The VR Oculus in my painting represents technology as a means to close the gap in achieving and ensuring quality education. Some students assimilate better with auditory learning, some do better with visuals and others do well with role playing. In my painting, the student is able to learn about space and other planets better with the oculus.She performs better with visuals. Despite her disability(the wheelchair) and poor socioeconomic background(suggested by her minimalist clothing), she has been provided with the needed facility to learn at the same pace as her peers.I am an advocate for an equitable system of education, where students & teachers are given access to more creative methods of learning and teachers in turn tailoring their teaching styles to ensure all their students stand an equal chance at success.",

    "description": "This painting shows a face-to-face interaction between Nigerians at a news-paper spot somewhere in lagos.Human connection and technological progression are interconnected and have a significant impact on each other.On one hand, technological progressions have greatly enhanced human communication and connectivity. The advent of telephones, internet, and social media platforms has allowed people to connect with each other on a global scale. Distance is no longer a barrier when it comes to staying in touch with loved ones, conducting business, or forming new relationships. This has brought people closer together, fostering a sense of global community and understanding.Additionally, technology has enabled people to share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences with a wider audience. Social media platforms have become powerful tools for self-expression and raising awareness about various social issues. This has facilitated the formation of online communities and movements focused on common causes, allowing people to connect and fight for change together.However, it is crucial to note that technological progressions can also have negative effects on human connection. The prevalence of technology in our daily lives has led to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and a shift towards online interactions. People may spend excessive amounts of time on their devices, leading to social isolation, decreased empathy, and a reduced sense of belonging. The convenience of virtual interactions can sometimes come at the cost of genuine and meaningful connections with others.It is essential to strike a balance between technological advancements and human connection. While technology provides immense opportunities for connecting and engaging with others, it is important to prioritize and nurture offline relationships as well. Finding ways to use technology to enhance, rather than replace, human connection is key. By using technology as a tool to facilitate and strengthen relationships, we can harness the benefits of technological progressions while ensuring that human connection remains a vital part of our lives.",

    "description": "Inspired by the Igbo folk song 'Ka Esi Le Onye Isi Oche,' this work visually represents the journey of the tortoise and the elephant to the king's palace. Anagbado skillfully blends these two animal figures, creating a composition that requires closer observation to deconstruct what appears as abstract art at first glance may look abstract.\nUpon careful examination, one begins to discern the colourful tortoiseshell, ingeniously juxtaposed with a form that simultaneously evokes the tortoise's head and the elephant's trunk. This clever visual amalgamation alludes to the cunning nature of the tortoise in Igbo folklore.\nThe title 'Onye Isi Oche,' which translates to 'chairman' or 'leader,' alludes to the bait used by the tortoise to entice the elephant. In the folktale, this promise of being the chairman at the king's Ofala Festival is the tortoise's ploy to secure the king's daughter.

We all see ourselves being day to day fighters and warriors of a non ending war.These series takes mental pictures from history; war thorn areas with severe pain and hurt of innocent people and nation-love-driven soldiers who always end up in the worst place. Bringing these pictures in our present time how we all still yell and scream out of deep pain and anguish.My only prayer is we all on this earth learn to spread peace and love. War is ugly and as we progress on this series you see more reasons not to wish for it and it’s relations to our daily lives.",

    "description": "The story is a long one as to this came from deep within. A story I’ve been holding for a really long time , spending months thinking of how to make it visible. This is talking about the consequences of war , both past and present. How we don’t seem to actually get pass it. Lives gone ; kids , mothers , young men recruited as soldiers. It doesn’t just end. I remember vividly sitting in government/history classes years ago happily learning about the Nigeria/Biafra war like it was just mere ‘history’ class to learn just to pass Exams and make good grades. It was deeper than that as I grew up. The Ukraine Russia America issue keeps bringing back those memories and I just want it to all settle but ‘HOW’ is still the big question. In this piece you see a young boy carrying his little sister dead body cause obviously the war brings death and destruction of properties. I pray it all gets better. I pray for Ukraine. It’s just too much!!",

    "description": "Second installment of the Sanity collection. The man in the painting is slowly cracking. Men in most societies are painted to be totally devoid of emotions such as sadness, anxiety, fear, depression etc, as depicted in the use of black and white.The use of the colorful background symbolizes the society’s blindness to the constant pressure they put on the male sex.The once again seemingly silent scream plastered on his face symbolizes the males’ inability to properly show his emotions due to society’s constant misconceptions of how men are to act. As for the paisley print on the tie? That wasn’t just a design, it symbolizes something.The symbol sprang up millennia ago, somewhere between present-day Iran and Kashmiri region straddling the Indian-Pakistani border.At home on business men or cowboys,paisley is a remarkably versatile pattern that manages to be both manly and playful.",

They might not also understand the woes, bloodshed and unprovoked deaths left in the wake of terrorist attacks and insurgency up North because they do not leave in these regions or the many inter-tribal wars in many places in the nation. In all these one important lesson we must bear in mind is that war is bad and should be uncalled for. Youths nowadays must bear in mind that in all our doings, violence should and must never be an option. We must be diplomatic in our dealings with people. We shouldn’t be barbaric. Only those who have not had a taste of war would wish for it. Peace and love should be the message at all times.God bless us all!",

He wants to vent his anger out on all the wickedness, injustice and corruption going on in the world. He has these voices in his little head that council him with ageless wisdom, they talk him and they alone understand him. They tell him what to do. But he can’t speak out, perhaps out of fear; the fear of being castigated. Or perhaps because he feels is not worthy, or that he’s poor and nobody takes a poor man’s word for it. Or that he isn’t any better. Maybe he’s just a nobody. But this guilt keeps eating him up; the voices in his head keep talking, louder and louder, urging him, throbbing him and pushing him. They’re bottled up in his head until he wants to explode and cannot take it any longer.",

The contrast between the solid wood fist and the delicate glass bulbs creates a captivating visual juxtaposition, highlighting the duality of power and fragility.As a functional piece, this sculpture serves as a unique lighting fixture. The bulbs, held firmly in the fist's grasp, emit a soft, warm glow, casting an enchanting ambiance in any space. The illumination serves as a reminder that true power lies not only in physical strength but in wisdom, intelligence, and the ability to enlighten others.The sculpture evoke a sense of awe, inspiring viewers to reflect on the importance of wisdom and the strength it possesses.Dominion's Illumination is not just a stunning art piece but a thought-provoking symbol of power and supremacy.

This title evokes a sense of rebirth, resilience, and the triumph of transformation.The choice of materials, such as junk metals, adds depth and symbolism to the artwork. Each piece of metal, once considered worthless and discarded, finds new purpose and meaning in this dynamic sculpture. The motorcycle, a symbol of freedom, adventure, and speed, becomes a representation of the human spirit's ability to rise above adversity and reinvent oneself.The ascending position of the motorcycle suggests an upward trajectory, as if defying gravity and limitations. It signifies the artist's intention to convey the idea of personal growth, progress, and the continuous pursuit of excellence. The sculpture becomes a visual metaphor for the human journey, reminding us that no matter our starting point or the challenges we face, we have the potential to rise, surpass our limitations, and emerge stronger than ever before.",

    "description": "In this piece, the artist portrays a masquerade that manifests as three distinct entities akin to spiritual siblings. At the forefront stands a male figure, the guide.\nThe leader dons a traditional cap reminiscent of the Western Father Christmas hat. he holds a blue bag while a leather satchel hangs from his shoulder. These bags contain sacred elements crucial for the ceremony, used to summon and direct the three spirits he shepherds. In the background, two Uli Isi Oji symbols hover.\nThis work explores themes of spiritual leadership and the interconnectedness of the seen and unseen worlds.",

    "description": "Mugumo \nIn this work, Anagbado explores the intersection of cultural mythology and contemporary artistic techniques, drawing inspiration from the sacred Mugumo tree of the Agikuyu people. By employing laser etching on wood, he creates a dialogue between traditional reverence and modern technology.\n\nThe Mugumo, a centuries-old symbol of peace and spiritual connection for the Kikuyu of East Africa, serves as the central reference. This choice reflects his interest in how ancestral wisdom and beliefs continue to resonate in our present day. The tree, capable of living over 500 years, embodies the endurance of cultural memory and the timeless nature of human spirituality.\n\nThe artistic process involves a delicate balance of positive and negative space, creating an abstract representation of the Mugumo's form. The intricate laser-etched lines evoke the complex network of branches, roots, and cultural significance woven through the tree's existence. This approach invites viewers to engage with the piece as they might a maze, encouraging a meditative journey through the work.\n\nA single branch, highlighted in acrylic, serves as both a focal point and a metaphor. It represents the individual's connection to their cultural heritage - a vibrant, living link amidst the broader tapestry of tradition and belief.",

    "description": "In this thought-provoking piece, the artist focuses on depicting a musical orchestra, presenting seven figures with only six visible heads. Through this composition, the artist critically examines the impact of mobile phone usage during live performances and events.\nThe work challenges viewers, who may recognize their own behaviour in the scene, to consider how individuals today often prioritize capturing moments for future reference over fully experiencing the present.\nOn the right-hand side, a man wearing his age-grade society uniform is portrayed holding a phone, his head conspicuously absent from the frame. This element alludes to the generational shifts occurring regardless of social status or tradition.\nBy juxtaposing traditional musical performances with modern technology, the artist explores themes of presence versus documentation, the evolution of social interaction, and the tension between preserving and experiencing events.\nThis piece invites viewers to reconsider their habits and the value of unmediated experience in an increasingly digital world.",

    "description": "Ndi Nze n' Ozo' offers a compelling glimpse into the hierarchy and traditions of Igbo society, focusing on the esteemed red cap chiefs. Anagbado skillfully portrays these respected figures seated at a vibrant ochre-coloured table, their distinctive red caps varying in size and shape, symbolizing their ranks and achievements.\n\nCentral to the composition is a dominant figure, distinguished by two long feathers adorning his cap, signifying his elevated status within the group. The inclusion, adornment and arrangement of the women in the frame leave the viewer to presume that these are the chiefs' wives, an allusion to the seat given to the women in Igbo society.\n\nIn the background, two Ise Oji symbols lend spiritual and cultural context to the scene, anchoring the gathering in Igbo cosmology and tradition. The foreground, framed by the table's edge, features a bag and a drinking cup, subtle yet significant elements that hint at ritual and communal practices.\n\nThe work invites viewers to consider the complexities of traditional governance systems and their enduring relevance in contemporary society.",

    "description": "In 'Okpa Oku,' the artist presents a striking contemporary interpretation of youth culture juxtaposed with traditional Igbo aesthetic elements. The piece centres on a young woman's leg, her head deliberately excluded from the frame, drawing focus to the vibrant lower body and its surroundings.\nThe subject sports a bold red boot, a powerful visual anchor that may allude to the 'oku' (fire) in the title, suggesting youth, passion, or dynamism. The trousers feature a lively, multi-coloured check pattern, embodying the eclectic nature of modern fashion and youth expression.\nContrasting these contemporary elements, the artist envelops the figure's visible body in intricate Uli lines - a traditional Igbo art form. These lines, taking various shapes and forms, create a fascinating dialogue between the past and present.\nThrough this composition, Anagbado explores themes of cultural continuity and generational shifts.",
